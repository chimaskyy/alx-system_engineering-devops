# Networking Basics
## OSI(Open System Interconnection)
A conceptual framework that standardizes and defines the functions of a telecommunication or networking system. It's designed to help understand and organize the various aspects of networking, allowing different technologies and protocols to work together.

## Made up of 7 layers
### Pysical Layer:
The physical layer deals with the actual physical transmission of data over the network medium. It defines the hardware, cables, connectors, and the physical characteristics of the medium. Example of the pysical layer; cables, Modem, Routers, Switches, Connectors etc.

### Data Link layer:
Responsible for establishing a reliable link between two directly connected nodes and ensuring error detection and correction. It is divided into two sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). Ethernet is an example of a data link layer technology.
