Two additional element to the design
- Firewall
- SSl
Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. 
The first firewall controls and monitors incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules(protocols).
The second protects web app and services hosted on the servers. Also prevents malicious attack
The third acts as a circut level firewalls
-HTTPS(SSL) is added for encryption of communication between browser and web server. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user's browser and a website.
- Monitoring system  of used for observing, tracking, and analyzing various aspects of a system or network to ensure performance, security, and reliability.
- How monitoring system collects data:
Engineers install software, called an agent, on their hosts. Hosts may include physical servers, also called bare metal servers, or virtual machines which use the resources of a physical server. The agent collects infrastructure metrics from hosts and sends the data to a monitoring platform for analysis and visualization.

### Issues with the design
- Terminating SSL at Load Balancer: This culd lead to security breach.
- Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem, they are susceptible to shared vulnerabilities, and issues affecting one server may impact others similarly. Furthermore, such a setup limits the ability to optimize each component independently based on its specific requirements.
